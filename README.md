The idea is simple in certain protected envs you are faced with the fact that the UTM (in my case my new office) is blocking outgoing traffics universally to the unpriviledged ports usually the ones that are unfamiliar. This I presume is due to the fact
to protect themselves any malware infection. Hence my higher-port obfuscator is affected in my private tor circuit. I either need to change the listen config which causes all the clients needing to change that or otherwise run this tiny nginx docker in 
TCP mode where it gets the traffic and passes to obfuscator. lets see ;)
